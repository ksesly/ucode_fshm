        <h2 id="upper_header">What makes a superhero?</h2>
        <p>Superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability 
            to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. 
            So in order to be a superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power 
            a normal human being could possess</b>, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. 
            Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero. For instance, 
            a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or 
            human-interest story. <i>But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, 
            it becomes a superhero story.</i> If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t 
            do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>

            Batman is a superhero published by DC Comics. Operating in Gotham City, 
            he serves as its protector, using the symbol of a bat to strike fear into 
            the hearts of criminals. Unlike other superheroes, Batman is often depicted to lack any 
            "superpowers", instead using lifelong training and equipment to fight crime. His secret identity is Bruce Wayne, 
            a rich playboy and philanthropist who swore to fight crime after witnessing his parents' brutal murder.</p>
