                        has the ability to resurrect and conjure the spiritual representation of the people who are
                        dead. Additionally, the Soul Stone can give sentience to inanimate objects; the Infinity Crusher
                        was dormant until empowered by the Stone, at which point it sought out the other Stones. </td>

                        Manipulation of time then occurs primarily through the conjuration of a green, circular mandala of
                        energy in the user's hand. The mandala acts as a rudimentary "dial", and the manual turning of the
                        mandala with the user's hand enables them to "scroll" both backwards and forwards through time.

                    <td>Drawing power from space, the Space Stone's source of energy is so great that many consider its
                        volumes of energy to be unlimited. Due to this, the Space Stone is capable of powering or repairing
                        objects and artifacts of incredible power. A single spark of its power was enough to create a small
                        explosion. HYDRA was able to use the Space Stone's energy within the Tesseract to power advanced
                        vehicles and weapons of mass destruction including guns, tanks, and bombs that vaporized their
                        targets.</td>

                    <td>As the Infinity Stone that represents and governs the fabric of mind, the Mind Stone grants whoever
                        holds it complete control over the hearts and minds of others. Like with all the other Infinity
                        Stones, it is among the most powerful artifacts in all existence. At its core, the Stone contains a
                        highly advanced intelligence framework, akin to an incredibly powerful supercomputer operating
                        similarly to a sentient mind.</td>

                    <td>Red</td>
                    <td>The Reality Stone granted its user absolute control over the fabric of reality itself. However, like
                        all Infinity Stones, it can only be wielded by beings of sufficient power. When allowed to influence
                        an average human it will inevitably kill them, as evidenced by Jane Foster. The Reality Stone's
                        power is such that it can affect reality on a universal scale. Had Malekith succeeded in either of
                        his attempts to use the stone's power, the entire universe would've been converted to dark matter.
                        The stone is also nearly indestructible, being able to withstand blows from Mj√∏lnir. </td>

                    <td>Purple</td>
                    <td>The Power Stone grants its wielder tremendous energy manipulation capabilities. Due to the amount
                        of energy the Power Stone releases, it is the most destructive out of all the Infinity Stones in
                        terms of raw power. Like all Infinity Stones, the Power Stone is among the most powerful artifacts
                        in the universe, with only beings of an extraordinary constitution being able to use it while less
                        powerful beings would erupt in a violent explosion. The more powerful the being is, the longer it
                        takes for the Power Stone to destroy. </td>
